    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I’ve been providing in-home overnight pet sitting services since 2019. Throughout my life, I’ve had the privilege of caring for a wide variety of animals—including dogs, cats, birds, fish, lizards, hamsters, chickens, and horses. I’m based in West Atlanta and often travel throughout the country for pet sitting. I treat your pets and your home with the same care and attention I would give my own. A complimentary meet & greet is required prior to the first stay.</p>

    <h2>Verified Reviews</h2>

    <p><strong>Carly T:</strong> "Anne did a fantastic job caring for our senior cat while we were out of the country for 10 days. She sent daily updates and a ton of photos and videos. We returned home to a very content cat—and our house was maybe even a little cleaner than we left it!"</p>

    <p><strong>Trey S:</strong> "Anne was amazing! Peggy was a little nervous at first, but she quickly figured out Peggy’s love language and won her over with treats and cuddles. The attention to detail and sense of compassion was easily seen and felt."</p>

    <p><strong>Blake C:</strong> "Anne was amazing with our dogs and cats! She made sure they were well-fed, exercised, and happy during her daily visits. Highly recommend Anne for anyone needing pet care!"</p>
